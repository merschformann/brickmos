[![pypi_version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/brickmos?label=pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/brickmos)[![build](https://github.com/merschformann/brickmos/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/merschformann/brickmos/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is a simple tool for converting images to Lego mosaics such that their
parts can be ordered quite easily from bricklink (https://www.bricklink.com/).
I wrote this for myself for a birthday present I worked on, but wanted to leave
it here for others to re-use or as inspiration.

## Motivation & alternatives

This is a rather simple script which worked well for me, as I went back and
forth between my image editing tool and modifying the color pallet. I really
like this continuous process of shaping the result while keeping colors/brick
types and their prices under control. I even ended up replacing one 1x1 plate
with a 1x1 tile, since the respective color was too expensive on bricklink.
Furthermore, I was only interested in full 1x1 mosaics, similar to the Lego
mosaic art product line. I also ended up buying the frame parts used for the
Lego art frame, as it is extendable and easily wall-mountable (see [here](https://www.lego.com/de-de/campaigns/art/)).

However, if you are more interested in a GUI application, different workflow or
automatically chosen larger than 1x1 pixels, you may want to have a look at the
following alternatives (if I forgot an alternative here, let me know):

- Bricklink studio (full-blown brick set designer with a mosaic feature, (see
  [here](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page))
- PicToBrick (specifically made for brick mosaics, see [here](http://www.pictobrick.de/en/pictobrick.shtml))

## Quickstart

The following should get you started.

### Dependencies

Main dependencies are:

- Python (I used python 3.8)
  - `opencv-python` (the version I used is defined in _requirements.txt_)

If you run into problems missing `libGL.so`, install the following:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-glx
```

### Installation

Install via PyPi

```bash
pip install brickmos --upgrade
```

### Process an image

Convert an image by invoking the script as follows:

`brickmos --image_file data/iron-man-portrait.jpg --output_directory="temp"`

Or alternatively clone this repo and run it directly:

`python run.py --image_file data/iron-man-portrait.jpg --output_directory="temp"`

Repeat the process while modifying the original image (change colors in areas
not working well, change colors overall, etc.) and limiting / extending the
colors (add useful ones, remove expensive ones) until you are satisfied with the
outcome (and price ;) ).

### Import parts to bricklink

1. Login at [https://www.bricklink.com/](https://www.bricklink.com/)
1. Go to __Want > Upload__ (see [here](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/wanted/upload.page))
1. Choose ___Upload BrickLink XML format___
1. Copy & paste (ctrl-a, ctrl-c, ctrl-v) the XML output of the tool into the window
1. _Proceed to verify items_ and add all to a wishlist (please double-check the
   items, before ordering)

## Further information

Find some further definitions below.

### Parameters

Find a short explanation of the parameter arguments below.

#### Required arguments

- `--image_file, -i`: the path to the (original) image to process, can be a
  _.jpg_  or _.png_ file

#### Optional arguments

- `--color_file`: the csv-file defining the brick-colors to be used (if not
  given, colors.csv at script location is attempted), see format description
  below
- `--output_directory, -o`: the directory the output image and BOM is written to
  (default is current working directory)
- `--spares`: the number of spares to add per color/brick (in bricklink BOM),
  just in case of loosing some bricks
- `--size`: the width/height of the image in 1x1 bricks (default is _48x48_ -
  same as current Lego art)
- `--grid_cell`: the size of one cell in the helper grid (e.g.: _4x4_), the
  helper grid is useful as a guide when finally placing the bricks, it can be
  deactivated by specifying _none_

## Color definition

The set of available colors is defined by the csv-file (`--color_file`, see
above). The following information is required.

```text
rgb         ; Bricklink Color Name ; Bricklink Color ID ; Bricklink Part ID
255,255,255 ; White                ; 1                  ; 3024
175,181,199 ; LightBluishGray      ; 86                 ; 3024
89,93,96    ; DarkBluishGray       ; 85                 ; 3024
33,33,33    ; Black                ; 11                 ; 3024
```

This is an example set of colors for a 4 'color' black & white picture using 1x1
plates. The example is already in expected format. The format requires a header
line and semicolons as column delimiters. The values used here should be aligned
with the definitions on bricklink for the export to work properly (see
[https://www.bricklink.com/catalogColors.asp](https://www.bricklink.com/catalogColors.asp)).

More details about each column:

- The first column is the RGB value of the corresponding color. There is no
  official definition of these from Lego, thus, use something as close as
  possible you can find. I picked the colors defined on the bricklink page.
- The second column is just a recognizable name for the color. Using the
  bricklink name seems reasonable.
- The third column is the bricklink color ID (see page mentioned before). This
  is important for the XML-export to function properly.
- The fourth column is the bricklink brick type ID. You can find these in
  bricklinks database. Since the script only considers 1x1 parts, only these
  should be used. The _3024_ from the example is the 1x1 plate (see [here](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3024#T=C)).
  Other options include, but are not limited to, 1x1 tiles (3070b, see [here](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3070b#T=C))
  or 1x1 plate round (4073, see [here](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=4073#T=C)).
  Note that prices vary _a lot_ with color **AND** brick type. For my own mosaic
  I used 1x1 plates, but replaced an expensive color with a much cheaper 1x1
  tile.
